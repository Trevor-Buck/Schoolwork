# Schoolwork
This repository holds all of my projects, homework assignments, and more from my 3 years as a student at the University of Colorado-Boulder.


The biggest demonstration of my work can be found in my Senior Capstone video (Link Below).  This was a year long project in which we worked with our Sponsor, TkMomentum, to create a web application for grocery stores.  We built the app from the ground up.  Including linking the databases from the different grocery stores.  My work focused on the Employee UI. Because the majority of the employees were disabled in a variety of ways, we had to come up with clever solutions for signing in.  We also had to make an app that was very simple to use and easy to understand.
